# Deep_Reinforcement_Learning_Robotics
Code from my dissertation on autonomous robots.

The dissertation's PDF can be found inside the github repository.

The project looked at the relationship between classical conditioning and deep reinforcement learning.
Code was written in PyTorch with a custom Hebbian Learning rule.
